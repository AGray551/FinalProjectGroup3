Campus Event Tracker â€“ Design Document
 
1. Introduction
 
The Campus Event Tracker is a mobile/web application designed to help students discover, RSVP to, and get reminders for campus events. It centralizes event information from various departments and student organizations, making it easier for students to stay engaged with campus life.
 
 2. Storyboard (Screen Mockups)
 
Screens:
- Login / Signup
- Event Feed (List of upcoming events)
- Event Details (Date, time, location, description, RSVP)
- My Events (RSVPed events, reminders)
- Create Event (For organizers)
- Settings (Notification preferences, profile)
 
Mockups will be created using [PowerPoint / Figma / FluidUI].
 
3. Functional Requirements
 
 Requirement 1
As a student 
I want to browse upcoming campus events 
So that I can decide which ones to attend
 
- Given I am logged in 
- When I open the event feed 
- Then I see a list of upcoming events with key details
 
Requirement 2
As a student 
I want to RSVP to events 
So that I can receive reminders and updates
 
- Given I am viewing an event 
- When I click RSVP 
- Then the event is added to my calendar and I receive notifications
 
Requirement 3
As an event organizer 
I want to create and publish events 
So that students can discover and attend them
 
- Given I am logged in as an organizer
